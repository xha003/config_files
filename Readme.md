# config_files
This repo consists of the config files for different tools that I have been using. Right now I have pushed only the vim config.

If you wish to use this configuration or some modified version of it, you can just clone this repo and make changes accordingly.

For now, if you need vim to work with the pushed configurations:

1. `git clone git@github.com:xha003/config_files.git --recursive`
2. `cd config_files`
3. `ln -s $PWD/vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc`
4. `ln -s $PWD/vim/.vim ~/`

And you are done! All the configurations should work fine. If you have any trouble using or following the instructions, please donot hesitate to post an issue. I will try and help as soon as I can.

P.S: I am still a beginner with all this. So if you find any thing that you see out of place, feel free to send a pull request.
